# KMClustering

Analyze the clusters and common properties found for each cluster with dataset at  https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits 



# CONCLUSION:

### We can further improve the clustering.

+ Choosing optimal value of K(number of clusters).

+ Merging neighboring clusters if the resulting cluster's variance is below the threshold.

+ Running the algorithm using different initializations of centroids.

+ Standardize the data
